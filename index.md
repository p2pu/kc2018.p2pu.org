title: P2PU Gathering Kansas City
---

May 17-18, 2018
 
Hi there!
 
We’re hosting a 2-day gathering of learning circle practitioners in Kansas City on May 17-18, 2018 - up to join?
 
Starting with Chicago Public Library in 2015, learning circles are now being run in 27 public library systems across the United States and Canada and 13 branches of the Kenya National Library Service. Wow! That’s a lot of learning! More than 1000 study group meetings actually. However, except for a few chance encounters, we’ve never been able to meet up in person to share our experiences and plans.
 
With the support of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, P2PU and Kansas City Public Library will be hosting a first-of-its-kind gathering of learning circle practitioners and peer learning advocates.
 
## Goals
 
You can’t run a learning circle without setting goals, right? Together, our meeting aims to achieve the following:

1. Create an interactive and supportive environment for learning circle practitioners to meet and get to know one another forming the foundation to a community of practice
1. Share, listen to and document stories, outcomes, and best practices for supporting community-based peer learning approaches and running learning circles within libraries and other community centres
1. Model and share interactive exercises and tools that could be integrated into learning circles or other learning programs
1. Discuss P2PU vision, goals and future opportunities for growth
1. Build consensus around the learning circle mode, values, benefits and onboarding process[
 
## Location and Details
 
The event will be hosted at the Kansas City Public Library Main Branch located at … in Kansas City, Missouri, USA. The program will begin with an optional dinner on Wednesday May 16th, with the official program beginning on the morning of Thursday May 17th ending in the late morning of Friday May 18th.
 
 - Wednesday, May 16 - Welcome Kansas City BBQ Dinner
 - Thursday, May 17 - Full day program with breakfast and lunch
 - Friday, May 18 - Morning Reception ending at noon
 
## Guest list
 
We welcome attendance from all learning circle practitioners, facilitators, P2PU friends and supporters, librarians and educators, and those committed to peer, community-based, equitable and open learning. Our aim is for this to be an intimate and interactive event that will host between 30 – 40 participants.
 
Confirmed attendance includes the entire P2PU Staff Nico, Dirk, and Grif (we live in three different countries – so this is a rare event!), learning circle facilitators and librarians from Chicago Public Library, Wichita Public Library, Tampa-Hillsborough Public Library, Twin City Public Library, Charlotte Mecklenburg Public Library, and of course let’s not forget Kansas City Public Library too. We also plan to host long-time P2PU advocates and others who have been running learning circles in community centers, literacy centers and immigrant learning centers.
 
 
## Lodging
 
It’s up to you on where you stay! We are not planning on organizing pre-booked hotel rooms or discounted rooms. However, in the coming weeks we will be listing hotels nearby to the Main Branch that are recommended by Kansas City Public Library.
 
Also, in case you were wondering, we didn’t end up finding a big monster mansion to host everyone L We really tried, but it didn’t seem feasible. Next time, we promise J
 
## Registration
 
If you would like to attend, we would love to have you. Our only expectation is that those who attend will be able to actively contribute their experience and have an interest in the development of learning circles and P2PU.
 
No big registration process necessary and no registration fees. Register by sending Nico a message at Nico@p2pu.org and confirm the names of those who will be attending. We’ll follow up with other details or questions that we might have for you.
 
## FAQ
 
*I’ve never run or supported a learning circle or P2PU before, can I still come?*

Maybe. This is private event, but we’re open to those who are truly interested our collective work. Send Nico a message and let us know why you’re interested on coming (nico@p2pu.org)
 
*Is there any way P2PU can help pay for me or my colleague come?*

Don’t bet on it. We’ll looking into sponsors, but as of right now, there is no additional funding to help get you to Kansas City.
 
*How much does it cost to attend?*

There are no fees to attend. Getting yourself to Kansas City and paying for accomodation and some food will be your main costs. We will be providing dinner, breakfast and lunch, so that should take the costs down a bit.
 
*Will we will be able to participate in the conference online?*

No, we do not have any plans to connect our meeting with an online audience. We could imagine organizing a session that allows for greater input from those who are not able to attend, however the primary purpose of the event will be to support in-person discussion.
 
*Will the event be live streamed or recorded?*

We plan to record as much as we can and share what we learned with everyone else, likely through photos, short videos, and a written summary. However, there won’t be hour long recorded lectures so that you can “learn online” at home, that’s not really our style.
